> 🔴 **⚠️ WARNING – Script No Longer Functional (as of mid-May 2025)**  
>  
> After working reliably for over 2.5 years, this script no longer works due to **major changes in Instagram's API and story payloads** introduced in **May 2025**.  
> Instagram has:
> 
> - Broken access to **private stories** first, then extended this to **public stories (especially videos)**.  
> - Begun **splitting story videos into dozens of unusable fragments**, including:  
>   - Video chunks with **no video track** (just sound),  
>   - Segments that **cannot be played individually**,  
>   - Payloads that are dynamically generated and **hidden from browser DevTools**.
> 
> These changes have effectively **broken all current methods and tools** (including popular third-party story saver websites) that used to extract stories.
> 
> **Until new workarounds are discovered, this script is deprecated.** Feel free to watch the repo in case future updates bring a solution.
